# Dynamic-Shopping-List-Calculator
ðŸ”¥A Dynamic Shopping List Calculator is a simple web application that allows users to add items to a shopping list along with their prices. The application dynamically updates a table displaying the items and their prices, and it automatically calculates the total cost of all added items.
Key Features:
âœ… Users can enter an item name and price in input fields.
âœ… Clicking the "Add" button adds the item and its price to a table.
âœ… The total price updates automatically as items are added.
âœ… Option to remove items from the list (if needed).

How It Works:
Input Fields â€“ Users enter the item name and price.
Add Button â€“ When clicked, the item gets added to the price table.
Dynamic Updates â€“ The table updates with each new item, and the total price is recalculated.
